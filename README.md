# DataScience-Toolkit

Collection of tools for various Data Science tasks. 

This is a personal reference for professional and personal projects. 

As such, this is not intended to be an easy set of tools that can be picked up and easily copy pasted, but rather as a set of templated commands that can be put together to create tools, and fulfill data science tasks.

Still in the process of porting over code from prior projects, so this collection of tools is very much a constant work in progress.
